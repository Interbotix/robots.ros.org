introduction: The LoCoBot is a mobile manipulator from Carnegie Mellon University and designed to run Facebook AI's PyRobot. PyRobot is an open source, lightweight, high-level interface on top of the robot operating system (ROS). It provides a consistent set of hardware-independent mid-level APIs to control different robots. PyRobot abstracts away details about low-level controllers and interprocess communication so users can focus on building high-level AI robotics applications.
